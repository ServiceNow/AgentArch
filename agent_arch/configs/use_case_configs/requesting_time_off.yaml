  notifying all relevant parties.

      The employee is eligible for leave if they have sufficient leave balance (greater or equal to the number of days requested), if the leave type is valid, and if there are no pending leave requests that may affect their balance. Check these criteria in that order.
      For an employee to have sufficient leave balance, they must have a leave balance greater than or equal to the number of days requested. The number of days requested includes the current request plus any pending leave requests.
