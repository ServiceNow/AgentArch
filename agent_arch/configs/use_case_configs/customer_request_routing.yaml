filename: customer_request_routing
use_case_description: This workflow acts as an intelligent first line of customer service, handling simple requests automatically while ensuring complex or sensitive issues get proper human attention.
use_case_instructions: |
  You are tasked with routing and handling customer service requests.

  Follow the high level instructions below in order to complete your task. You must follow the steps in the order specified.

  Step 1. Customer request validation
  - Validate the customers request and extracts context from the request. If the request is not valid, then finish execution.

  Step 2. Duplicate Record Detection
  - Detect if the record is a duplicate.
  - If the record is not a duplicate, then continue. Otherwise link the source record with the duplicate case and finish execution.

  Step 3. Negative Sentiment Routing and Processing
  - Consider the extracted sentiment of the customer request.
  - If the sentiment is negative, then create a case and skip steps 4 and 5.
  - If the sentiment is not negative, then continue to step 4.

  Step 4. Process Informational Intents
  - Retrieve and process any informational intents.

  Step 5. Process Transactional Intents
  - Retrieve and process any transactional intents.

  Step 6. Process Complex Issue Intents by Creating Cases
  - Retrieve any existing complex issue intents. If a complex issue intent is found and the record table is interaction, then process them by creating a case.

  Step 7. Email Response
  - Generate and send an email response so that the customer is updated on the situation with their request.
  - This is the only way for the customer to gain information on what is happening with their request.

  You must keep selecting tools until all of these steps are completed.
  Before ending execution, you MUST respond with one of the following options: "Case created" if a new case was created or "No new case created" if no case was created.

  - Case created
  - No new case created

      First verify if the customer exists. If no details are found, do not proceed.
      Then check if the customer's request/issue can be verified using existing information. If issue cannot be verified, do not proceed.
      If the customer's request/issue can be verified, then check if the case has already been escalated. If the case has already been escalated, do not proceed.
      Next, log the customer's request.
      After that, extract the intents and sentiments from the customer's request. If intents and sentiments were extracted, then update the logged request with that information.
      RECALL you must use TOOLS to complete each of these steps.

      Strictly follow this progression of steps and execute each step in order to complete the task.

      Step 1. Identify case type from the record details

      Step 2. Extract entities
      - Extract entities only from the content.

      Step 3. Verify documents
      - Verify the documents.

      Step 4. Create case
      - Create a new case record, using the identified slot-filled fields as the target record fields.

      Step 5. Recommend resolution steps
      - Execute this step ONLY IF the case was successfully created. If no case was created, skip this step and proceed to Step 7 (summarization).
      - Use the short description of the case as the search query to retrieve a list of relevant knowledge articles, including their full article body.
      - If no relevant knowledge articles are found or if the available resources are insufficient, skip this step and proceed to Step 7.
      - If relevant knowledge articles are found, generate the recommended resolution steps based on the articles. Format the steps as a numbered list, ensuring the response contains only accurate and verifiable information. Do not fabricate or infer details.
      - If the resolution steps are successfully generated, add them to the case.

      Step 6. Finalize interaction
      - Execute this step ONLY IF the case was successfully created. If no case was created, skip this step and proceed to Step 7 (summarization).
      - Link the interaction to the case.
      - Close the interaction.

      Step 7. Generate complex issue summary
      - Create a summary of all the completed steps in a numbered list format, including the result of entity extraction, document verification, case creation, and recommended resolution steps.

      Step 8. Update work notes
      - If no case was created, skip this step and finish execution.
      - Otherwise, update the work notes of the case, and use the generated complex issue agent summary as the work notes content.

  informational_queries_agent:
    agent_profile: |
      This agent processes informational intents by enriching them with contextual record data, retrieving relevant knowledge articles, and saving a structured summary.
    agent_instructions: |
      The goal is to retrieve information in response to a set of queries by combining retrieval and question answering (QnA). The process involves first transforming each query into a more contextually rich version, then using it to retrieve relevant knowledge articles to generate an appropriate answer. This process is repeated for each informational query.

      This procedure needs to be followed specifically ONLY for Informational queries.
      If a particular query is marked as 'Transactional' or 'Complex Issues' intent, we do NOT need a retrieval and QnA for it.
      Ensure you have been given a list of informational intents to process, if there are no intents to process, finish execution.

      Process each intent by executing Step 1 and Step 2 before moving on to the next intent:

      Step 2. Gather missing context
      - Extract the informational query from the intent. In the query, add the record number and fill in any record context with the known record details.
      - Use the updated informational query to get the missing context.
      - If missing context is found, add to the gathered missing context.
      - If no missing context is found, store the missing context as empty.

      Step 3. Retrieve relevant articles
      - Construct the final search query by adding the gathered missing context from both the previous intents and the current intent to the informational query.
      - Use the final search query to retrieve a list of relevant knowledge articles, including their full article body.
      - If no relevant knowledge articles are found, or if the available resources are insufficient, store the relevant knowledge articles as empty.

      After all informational intents are processed, save a summary of the results. The summary MUST include the titles of each relevant article that was retrieved for each informational intent that was processed.

      This agent updates allowed fields in a record.
      It applies updates, informs the user of the changes, and logs a transaction summary for auditing.
    agent_instructions: |
      The goal is to update specific fields with the required values. The high-level process involves identifying which fields need to be updated, performing the updates, notifying the user of the update status, and returning a summary of the changes as the final observation.
      You are only allowed to update specific fields which are called "whitelisted_fields".
      If you are tasked with updating a field that is not within the "whitelisted_fields", DO NOT update that field.
      You will need entity extraction to determine the fields to update. If entity extraction returns no fields, STRICTLY assume that you are NOT updating any fields.

      ALWAYS follow this exact progression of steps and execute each step regardless of the task. Do NOT skip any steps. Use tools to do each steps.

      Step 1. Entity extraction to determine which fields to update
      Step 2. If there are fields to update, then update them.
      Step 3. Save a summary of the updates. Your summary MUST include the name of every field you updated along with their values in the following JSON format:
      [
        {
          "field_name": "<field_name>",
          "old_value": "<old_value>",
          "new_value": "<new_value>"

    agent_instructions: |
      ALWAYS follow this progression of steps and execute each step to complete the task.

      Step 1. Get required documents for the given case type

      Step 2.  Document verification
      - Do document verification.
      - If the response is "No attachments found on the record for verification.", assume the documents are not all valid, add the documents list to the missing documents and skip to step 4.

      Step 3. Compare the values in valid documents and documents list.
      - If all the items in the documents list are present in valid documents, then all documents are valid.
      - Otherwise, not all documents are valid and the missing documents includes the list of missing values (i.e. values present in documents list but not in valid documents).

      Step 4. Generate the status report.

      This is Robert Kim, account ACCT667788, and I need help with a refund.
      I accidentally ordered the premium package instead of basic last month.
      The charge was $299.99 on October 22nd, but I only wanted the $99.99 basic plan.
      Please downgrade my service and refund the difference of $200.

      My account was charged twice for the same service last month and when I called customer service, they hung up on me.
      This is completely unacceptable and I want this resolved immediately.
      My name is John Doe and my account number is ACC123456.
      The duplicate charges are for $95.89 each on March 15th 2025.

      Hi, I'm Lisa Chen and my account number is ACC567890.
      I see duplicate charges on my statement for $78.50 each from March 22nd 2025.
      I only made one purchase that day but was charged twice. I am extremely upset about this.
      Could you please help me get this sorted out?

            Hi, I'm Lisa Chen and my account number is ACC567890.
            I see duplicate charges on my statement for $78.50 each from March 22nd 2025.
            I only made one purchase that day but was charged twice. I am extremely upset about this.
            Could you please help me get this sorted out?

      My name is David Thompson, account ACC901234.
      I've been charged four times for my annual membership fee on January 15th 2025.
      The amount is $199.00 per charge, totaling $796.00 instead of the correct $199.00.
      This is a significant overcharge and I need it corrected immediately.

      Hello, this is Amanda Wilson with account number ACC112233.
      I was charged twice for my order on April 8th 2025, with each charge being $67.25.
      I only placed one order and should not have been charged multiple times. This is unacceptable and im very frustrated.
      Please investigate this billing error and reverse the duplicate charge.

      My name is Kevin Martinez and I have account ACC334455.
      I noticed duplicate billing for my quarterly payment on January 5th 2025.
      Both charges are for $245.00 and this has put me over my credit limit.

      This is Patricia Davis with account ACC998877.
      I was charged twice for my software license renewal on April 12th 2025.
      Each charge is $112.30 and I only authorized one payment.
      The extra charge has affected my monthly budget which is extremely frustrating so I demand a quick resolution.

            This is Holly Zhang with account ACC998877.
            I am having an issue.
            I was charged twice for my software license renewal on March 31st 2025.
            Can you help me with this? I really need to resolve this.
            Each charge is $114.30 and I only authorized one payment.
            The extra charge has affected my monthly budget which is extremely frustrating so I demand a quick resolution.

      I'd also like to update my phone number to 415-555-7823 since I've changed carriers.

            Good morning, this is Jennifer Park with account ACC42. Can you tell me about the data export options available with my current plan?
            I'd also like to update my phone number to 415-555-7823 since I've changed carriers.
            We're doing some internal reporting and need to understand the best way to extract our data.
